I'm a begineer of AI, I started read paper such as ResNet and GAN, I think it's is important to know the architecture of a neural network but not use weights file.
So I decided to write this package, use torch's network's class to realise. In my opinion, there is only one thing you need to do, which is give it an object of net.
This package is realised by torch,plotly and numpy for now, I want to realise it not with math's way to draw it.I'm still looking for a package which can do this.
